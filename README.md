# Diagnosis with Optical Coherence Tomography

This project is about a model that predicts the diagnosis images scanned by OCR (Optical Coherence Tomography).


**OCR (Optical Coherence Tomography):** OCR is used to scan to the retinal layer of the eye as a cross-section with a laser.

**CNV:** Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the creation of new blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye.

**DME:** Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is an accumulation of fluid in the macula part of the retina that controls our most detailed vision abilities, due to leaking blood vessels

**DRUSEN:** Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina. Drusen are made up of lipids and proteins.

## ROC Curve

ROC Curve is used to that evaluate the performance of binary algorithms. It shows how successfully the model difference between classes.

* True Positive: TP
* False Positive: FP
* True Negative: TN
* False Negative: FN
* Sensitivity: True Positive Rate: TPR
* Specificity: True Negative Rate: TNR
